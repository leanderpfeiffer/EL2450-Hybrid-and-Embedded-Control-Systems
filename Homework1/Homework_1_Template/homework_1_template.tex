\section*{Instructions and Help}

\textbf{Please remove this part and the sample references before submitting your homework.}

Read the general homework instructions available on the course homepage before starting to write the report.

Here are some additional guidelines how to write a homework report.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Try, if possible, to work in teams of two students. The workload of the homework is for two students.
 \item Fill in name and personal number of all group members.
 \item Do not copy the task descriptions and use the structure below.
 \item Do not include code unless the task explicitly states so.
 \item Motivate your answers well and how you derived them, but be concise.
 \item The number of points is not necessarily related to much you need to write for task.
 \item Put references in the end if any.
 \item Do not include plots from the Simulink scope (color on black background) but export the data to Matlab for plotting.
 \item There is plenty of material available how to use Latex. Use a search engine of your choice to learn more.
\end{itemize}

Here are some examples how to use Latex:
\begin{itemize}
 \item An equation with a reference \eqref{eq_sample} to it
 \begin{equation}
  \dot{x} = \frac{3}{4} x. \label{eq_sample}
 \end{equation}
 \item A multi-line equations with a reference to it
 \begin{align*}
  \hat{x} &= x - y\\
  \alpha &= x + \gamma.
 \end{align*}
 \item An equation in text: $\Phi = \int\limits_{0}^{h} \mathrm{e}^{A\tau} d \tau$.
 \item An image
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{Phase_portrait_with_regionmark}
 \end{center}
 \item A table
 
 \begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 10.5pt depth4pt  width0pt}|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
     $-2.46$ & $0$ & $-1.73$ & $0$ \\ \hline
     $0$ & $-2.553$ & $0$ & $2.774$ \\ \hline
     $0$ & $6.172$ & $-10$ & $7.333$ \\ \hline
     $1.767$ & $-0.357$ & $5.714$ & $-6.074$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \item A citation \cite{Oetiker:2008:TheNotSoShortIntroductiontoLaTeXe}
  \item Display something exactly as it is written: \verb|\frac{1}{2}_|
  \item Basic formating: \textbf{bold}, \textit{italics}, \texttt{typewriter}
\end{itemize}
